## Bridging ArgoConnect to SparkFun Qwiic

ArgoQwiic is an open-source hardware project that creates a bridge between the ArgoConnect bus (Ethernet T1S and 12V) and the SparkFun Qwiic standard. This project aims to expand the interconnectivity of devices across these two ecosystems.

## Description

ArgoQwiic provides a hardware interface to seamlessly connect devices using the ArgoConnect bus with those compatible with the SparkFun Qwiic ecosystem. This bridge enables developers and makers to integrate a wider range of sensors, actuators, and other components into their projects, regardless of the native connection standard.

## Features

- Converts ArgoConnect (Ethernet T1S and 12V) to SparkFun Qwiic standard (I2C)
- Supports multiple Qwiic connections
- Power management for both 12V (ArgoConnect) and 3.3V (Qwiic) systems
- Designed using KiCAD for easy modification and improvement
- Compact form factor for easy integration into existing projects
- Robust ESD protection on all I/O

## Hardware

The hardware design is created using KiCAD, an open-source electronic design automation suite. The repository includes:

- Schematic files (.sch)
- PCB layout files (.kicad_pcb)
- Bill of Materials (BOM) (.csv)
- Gerber files for manufacturing
- 3D models for visualization (.step)

### Key Components

- Ethernet MAC/PHY for T1S
- Microcontoller for connection
- Voltage regulators for power management
- ESD protection ICs
- Qwiic connectors

## Getting Started

To get started with ArgoQwiic:

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the project in KiCAD (version X.X or later)
3. Review the schematic and PCB layout
4. Modify as needed for your specific application
5. Generate Gerber files for manufacturing

## Usage

1. Connect the ArgoConnect bus to the designated input on the ArgoQwiic board
2. Connect your Qwiic-compatible devices to the Qwiic connectors
3. Power up the system
4. Your ArgoConnect and Qwiic devices should now be able to communicate
